## What is the Serilog Contrib organization

The [Serilog Contrib organization](https://github.com/serilog-contrib) is a hub of community supported extensions for [Serilog](https://serilog.net) to help with discovery and collaboration across maintainers and contributors, as well as help with the long-term maintenance and longevity of Serilog extensions.

## Joining the Serilog Contrib organization

We're happy to welcome repositories which extend the Serilog ecosystem in the [Serilog Contrib organization](https://github.com/serilog-contrib).

Please [start a new issue](https://github.com/serilog-contrib/home/issues/new) to initiate the process of creating a new repository in the [Serilog Contrib organization](https://github.com/serilog-contrib) or transferring an existing repository to the [Serilog Contrib organization](https://github.com/serilog-contrib).

### What we'll ask of you

#### 1. Transfer your repository to the [Serilog Contrib organization on GitHub](https://github.com/serilog-contrib)
This makes it easier for discovery of the projects and for all contributors to follow activities / progress more easily, and other nice things such as tagging or assigning members of the org in issues and PRs

#### 2. Include the [Serilog-Contrib NuGet organization](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/serilog-contrib) as "_owner_" of the NuGet package(s) on nuget.org
This makes it possible for new releases to be published to nuget.org on your behalf, only if necessary and as a last resort to ensure the continuity of your project, in case the maintainers of the project are unable to do the release themselves.

### FAQ

#### What permissions will I have in my repository after I transfer it to Serilog Contrib?
You'll have full `Admin` permissions to your repository, and full control of its security settings (i.e. `Maintainer` role). You can give access to outside contributors to your repo as you wish.

#### Are there any requirements on licensing?
Transferring the repo does not require any change in licensing as long as the project is offered under a standard, permissive open source license such as Apache 2.0, MIT, BSD 3-Clause, and others. We generally recommend using Apache 2.0 to align with the license of Serilog itself, but changing the license of your project is _not_ a requirement.

#### Who owns the copyright after the repository is transferred?
Transferring the repo does not require any change in copyright. You'll retain the full copyright of your Serilog extension.

#### Can I continue to receive donations through GitHub sponsors and other platforms?
Absolutely. You can continue to encourage users of your extensions to donate directly to your project.

#### Who will make changes to the code in the repository?
Only the users that you authorize. Upon joining, you can choose to authorize the owners of the [Serilog Contrib organization](https://github.com/serilog-contrib) to assume the maintenance and/or to find a new maintainer in the event that you are no longer able or no longer interested in maintaining it.

#### Who will release new versions of the project?
Only the users that you authorize. Upon joining, you can choose to authorize the owners of the [Serilog Contrib organization](https://github.com/serilog-contrib) to release new versions of the project in the event that you are no longer able or no longer interested in maintaining it.
